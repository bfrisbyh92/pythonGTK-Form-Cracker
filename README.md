# pythonGTK-Form-Cracker
Just experimenting with a Python GTK GUI, that's going to take in a few paramaters and then either run hydra or nmap to crack forms displaying the output in my GTK GUI. The GUI is going to handle everything, just need to input a few values. A random cyber security project.

# To-DO
- Get Hydra output to correcly output in GTK
- Give this GTK some style and color


This is just my start. 2 days in with this build, so be nice.
